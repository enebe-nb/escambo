## Information

Node is required to download the dependencies and build the typescript code.

Some code won't work with Pixi version 8 and up, so keep it at version 7 or update the code.

The final files are saved in `dist` folder and the game can be tested by using a static server like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
